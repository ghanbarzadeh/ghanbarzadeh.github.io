## About Me

I Have a BSc in Mechanical Engineering from K.N. Tousi University of Tehran, and an MSc in Mechatronics Engineering from the same institution. My masters thesis was titled "Implementation of an intelligent control method for safe human and industrial robot collaboration" under the supervision of Dr. Esmaeil Najafi.  I hope to continue my studies in robotics and artificial intelligence. 

## Skills

- **Robotics:** human-robot collaboration and interaction, mobile robots, motion planning, path planning and obstacle avoidance (Dijkstra, A*, RRT, artificial potential fields)
- **Control:** reinforcement learning (PPO, DDPG, DQN, Q-Learning, SARSA), fuzzy logic, impedance control, sliding-mode control, LQR
- **Machine Learning:** SVM, KNN, clustering, regression, decision tree, bayesian inference, intelligent optimization (GA, PSO)
- **Neural Networks:** MLP, CNN, RNN, object detection, transformers
- **Machine Vision:** feature extraction, epipolar geometry, stereo vision, Kalman filter, particle filter
